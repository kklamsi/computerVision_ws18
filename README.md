## Task 2: Project Image recognition (with ResNets)

The goal is to train a neural network for visual recognition (i.e., given an image, predict its class label). Below is the original article explaining the details so called residual networks (ResNets), i.e., current state-of-the-art architecture for this type of problem. The task is to implement a ResNet and feel free to adjust things where you see fit. *Do not just copy the PyTorch example. Try to assess which parts of the architecture are more relevant than others recognition performance.
